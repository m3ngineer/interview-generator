# Data Science Interview Question Generator
Jobseekers can use this generator to practice their answers to data science-oriented interviews. These questions were based on my general experience interviewing with companies and on [120 Data Science Interview Questions](https://github.com/kojino/120-Data-Science-Interview-Questions). This program can generate both non-techical and basic technical questions.

## Application
This program with built using Python 3. To use, run `intprep.py.`
